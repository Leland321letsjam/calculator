# Foundations Final Project - Calculator

This is the final project of the Foundations course of The Odin Project program.
It will test my knowledge of everything that I have learned up to this point, including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- git version control system utilizing bash commands
- github remote repository

The finished version of this project should display my ability to:

- Use HTML to create the necessary elements
- Use CSS to style these elements
- Use JavaScript to add interactivity to these elements, including:
    - Functions to evaluate user inputted expressions
    - Display the output in HTML
    - Storing user inputted information for future use (such as an 'undo' button)
- Use JavaScript to handle large numbers and floating numbers
